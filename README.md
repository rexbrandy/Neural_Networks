# Neural Networks Learning 

This repo contains the small amount of machine learning python notebooks and python scripts I have written.

All of the files in this repo contain basic PyTorch functions and scripts I have made. They're mostly very basic and generic examples that I have used to improve my understanding of machine learning and neural networks.

Most Python notebooks have brief explanations and examples of the functions and how they work.

This is all stuff I have found online from Youtube/web tutorials or stuff I have completed in my Neural Networks course.
